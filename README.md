# Horiseon Code Refactoring

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Description

The reason for this project was to be given a working code riddled with non semantic elements, and refactor it using semantic elements instead; whilst also making sure everything works as originally intended. By continuous trials and tribulations through the HTML and CSS versions of this code, I was able to identify and understand the areas in which it needed to be cleaned up. It wasn't as simple as just changing a div class into an element, but getting the CSS prompts working along with the new HTML code. By using VSCode along with the website I was working on being able to see how certain functions would change things, furthered my understanding of how to properly format the code to get it working all together.
